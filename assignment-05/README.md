1) You can have many main document elements. The head elements give information about the document, such as the title, author, and publication date. This is what is thought to give the reader the summary, description, or thoughts about the page. The body element is the major part of the site. This is where all the information gets shared on the browser and displayed by the computer.
2) Structural makeup is the information about the structure of the document. It helps to give a guideline to the type of content that is in the document. The structural makeup consists of headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists. Semantic markup reiterates the meaning of the document. It also can add emphasis on words or phrases within the document. This can include citations, quotations, and links.
3) I had a small issue with Github. It wouldn't allow me to push my updates and it just continued to load for multiple hours. Other than that I followed along pretty easily and didn't find it too challenging. I was a little confused when it came to the semantic markups and if I was limited to certain indicators. I also was not sure if I used the correct University address, because when I clicked the link it just brought me to a page with the university's phone number and no email.
