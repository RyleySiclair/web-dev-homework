1) An id helps to identify a unique specific element. It is technically called a global identifier and should be different from every other element on the page. A class attribution is also an identifier. A class groups together similar elements by using the same name value. Elements may have more than one class. Divs provide structure without style or content and helps group other elements together. It helps to increase readability and clarity. Spans can live within a div and do not create blocks. You can have multiple span elements within a div. It can also help to identify text that needs to be unique to the page.
We use alt text because it is an attribute that is required in an element. We must meet the standards of proper style and accessibility in order to be properly read and understood.
Adding the service hosted links were a lot easier and more time efficient. I struggled a little with putting together the multiple source video, but finally got the hang of it. I was a little confused with how to add a google maps image with the location of the school. I wasn't sure if we were supposed to add an image of the google maps location, or if we were just supposed to list the address at the bottom of the page. I also was unsure if I did the image correctly. I was a little confused by that as well. Overall though I think I completed the assignment as it was supposed to be, while unsure about the address and the image.
