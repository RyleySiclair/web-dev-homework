Margin is the outer outer edge of an element. A margin is the space outside of the border. It is the very outer edge that contains everything else inside of it.The padding is the inner space of an element. It is the space inside of the border. The border lies between the margin and the padding. The content goes inside of the padding, which is inside of the border, which is inside of the margin.
The follow along video was very helpful as always, but for some reason my end result turned out a little bit differently. I must have forgotten something or made a mistake. It is fairly similar but everything is at the bottom of the screen instead of the top. I was also a little confused about how to make it more unique and original. I am fairly happy with the result for being a new web dev.
