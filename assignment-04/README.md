- I went to Spokane Washington. I was a little confused about what exactly we were supposed to be looking for, so I searched my home town. It looked pretty similar to what it is now compared to ten years ago. It was just a lot more updated and industrial. There were and still are a lot of pine trees all around the area.

- I learned a lot with this weeks lesson. I thought it was very helpful to see how we can do the same steps differently to be more efficient and make changes when we need to now. I think it can be hard to follow sometimes, which makes it a little complicated and difficult to understand, but overall I thought I accomplished what I needed to.
