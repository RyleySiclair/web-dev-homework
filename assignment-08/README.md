I think that the most difficult part was definitely remembering how to do things that we had already learned. It is hard to remember all of the steps and apply them in the process. I have to look back at older assignments which is very tedious and takes a lot of time. I am still confused by the purpose of some tools that we implement. I like learning the styling aspects, because it's fun to make the website your own and decorate the layout how you want it.
I am very excited to learn more about styling and decorating. This will allow us to be unique and get creative with our websites. I am a little nervous to see how difficult the process will be to understand, but I am ready for it.
I really liked this assignment because I felt that we had a lot more freedom. We were able to pick any type of lesson to teach. I chose a recipe, which was actually a lot of fun to create a website around. I had taken the skills that we had learned in previous lessons, and applied them to this new webpage. Sometimes I am still a little confused about what exactly all is supposed to be on the webpage, because the language confuses me at times, but overall I think I followed all the steps, and checked everything off the list. This assignment was probably my favorite thus far. I did do a lot of copying and pasting when it came to the more intricate details to save time and make sure that I didn't mess up typing the layout.
