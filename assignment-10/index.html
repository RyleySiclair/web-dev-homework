	       The whispers of the wind danced around her body, chilling it to awake. The tickle from the breeze opened her sleepy eyes. There she lay, one with the earth. Her gaze towards the sky and her spine to land. She was caressed by the blades of grass that hung to her every limb. The emerald vines spiralled up and down her body, clinging to her for life. Baby's breath sprung from her soft brown curls. Pedals of all shapes dusted her body in a gown of soft pinks. She was one with the earth.
      </p>

      <p>Her lungs were filled with life. The touch of damp grass tickled her finger tips. She reached deeper and felt the cold dense dirt crumble as she lifted it. Blushed cheeks and fair skin made her deep mossy eyes pop. As she awoke, so did the world around her. Sunshine beamed through the high pines. The song of wings played all around her. She continued to trace the ground with her gentle touch as she lay there. Aches and cracks came as her body came to life. Lifting her head, she separated her upper body from the earth. Her body rose like the sun. She stood tall and still as the trees that surrounded her. The forest was her home. She was one with the earth.
