System fonts are already installed onto a computer or device. A web font allows for users to to use fonts that are not already installed onto your computer. You can download these types of fonts and access them. Web safe font is a font that is installed onto computers and are used as a default.
Fallback fonts are important because if your primary font fails to load or has an issue, you will have a fallback font to be there as a backup. The fallback font is a good back up to have in case of emergencies. It acts as insurance if your first resort doesn't work out.
I followed along with the walk along, but in the end I ran into some errors. I think I must have improperly linked my index to my style page because nothing was changing colors or fonts. For some reason my assignment 10 tab said it was called assignment 9, which was incorrect because I linked and named it correctly and already had an assignment 9. I am not exactly sure what I did incorrectly. I also used my own short story which added a personal touch to this assignement.
