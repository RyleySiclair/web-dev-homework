My imaginary client is an up-and-coming writer. They wanted a site that they could post short stories on to share with the world. They wanted a site that was easy to to use and straightforward. It is a simple layout that doesn't distract the readers or make them confused. A site that is easy to read on and get lost in the stories/readings. In my mind, I was the client. I was making a site around what I would want for a blog.
There are differences between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block. Block displays an element on a new line while taking up the full width. The inline displays an element and is not effected by height or width properties. The inline-block displays an element as a container. It is formatted as an inline element and can have height and width values applied.
With this assignment I started with adding the four main documents and meta elements. I also created dropdown menus for three different sites. I implemented divs, and classes, as well as some ids. I also used some different fonts and colors to add some style. The walkthrough was long, but it really help me out a lot. I also realized that when I went to the assignments due up to this week, it was not showing the progress that I had accomplished within the activities and text.
